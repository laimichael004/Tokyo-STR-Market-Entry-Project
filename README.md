# Tokyo STR Market Entry Project
## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive data-driven analysis of Tokyo's short-term rental (STR) market, focusing on both mainstream and niche segments. The analysis leverages the Inside Airbnb dataset to inform strategic market entry decisions for possible expansion into Tokyo. The goal is to identify high-potential opportunities, assess competitive landscapes, and recommend targeted approaches for capturing market share in Japan's dynamic tourism and accommodation sector.

The project explores key trends, pricing dynamics, occupancy patterns, and regulatory influences shaping Tokyo's STR ecosystem. By segmenting the market into mainstream (e.g., central urban areas like Shibuya and Shinjuku) and niche (e.g., cultural districts or luxury experiences), we uncover actionable insights for sustainable growth.

This README accompanies the project's core deliverable: a slide deck report created in Canva, which visualizes findings through charts, maps, and infographics for easy stakeholder review.

## Project Objectives
- **Market Assessment**: Evaluate the size, growth, and saturation of Tokyo's STR market using real-time data.
- **Segmentation Analysis**: Examine mainstream and niche markets to uncover distinct opportunities and inform targeted product positioning.
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Benchmark against platforms like Airbnb, Booking.com, and local players.
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Propose entry tactics, pricing strategies, and marketing levers for GoTrip.

## Methodology
- **Data Source**: Primary analysis based on the Inside Airbnb dataset (scraped listings, reviews, and pricing as of Q2 2025).
- **Tools & Techniques**:
  - Data processing with Python (Pandas, NumPy) for cleaning and aggregation.
  - Visualization via Matplotlib and Power BI for geospatial and trend charts.
- **Scope**: Focused on Tokyo's 23 wards and key suburbs; time frame covers 2025 trends.
- **Assumptions**: Data reflects public listings; excludes off-platform or unregulated rentals.

## Key Findings
### Mainstream Market
- **Dominance of Urban Hubs**: ~70% of listings concentrated in Shinjuku, Shibuya, and Sumida, with average nightly rates of ¥13,000–¥20,000.
- **High Occupancy**: Peak seasons (cherry blossom, Olympics aftermath) show 80%+ utilization, but off-peak dips to 50%.
- **Competition Intensity**: Airbnb holds 60% share; pricing pressure from budget options erodes margins.
- **Nationality Distribution**: Japanese ~20 %, Korean ~15 %, Chinese ~15 %, American ~10 % (derived from reviewer names).

### Niche Market
- **Geographic Potential**: High-potential areas identified in Tokyo's western suburbs, including Tama, Mitaka, Musashino, Kyoose, and Inagi, characterized by residential neighborhoods with lower urban density and proximity to green spaces, offering untapped STR opportunities away from central saturation.
- **Listing Characteristics**: More than 30% of listings in these areas enforce minimum stays exceeding 30 nights, indicating a focus on longer-term, loyal guests rather than transient tourists, which supports stable occupancy and reduced turnover costs.
- **Demand & Supply Dynamics**: Balanced demand-supply equilibrium in these suburbs drives revenue increment potential, with underserved supply relative to growing interest from families, remote workers, and cultural explorers seeking authentic, quieter Tokyo experiences.

## Recommendations
1. **Entry Strategy**: Prioritize niche partnerships in underserved wards to build brand loyalty before scaling mainstream.
2. **Pre-Investment Intelligence**: Conduct targeted surveys and interviews with landlords and tenants to capture demographics, motivations, and platform barriers before selecting niche investment areas.
3. **Pricing Model**: Dynamic pricing tool targeting **¥16,000** average, with 10–15% buffers for peak events.
4. **Tech Integration**: Implement AI-driven matching for personalized recommendations to boost conversion by 20%.

## Deliverables
- **Slide Deck Report**: [View on Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAG04FZ9Eas/saitA0y7sPJbpTQt1qEV9A/edit?utm_content=DAG04FZ9Eas&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton) – 32-slide presentation with executive summary, data visuals, and appendices.
- **Interactive Dashboard** – Reduces **95%** query time (15 min → 45 sec) and saved **500+** hours/year for 5 users on dynamic querying of metrics by location, minimum night and room type.
